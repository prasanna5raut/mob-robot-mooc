# mob-robot-mooc
The repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments of the GeorgiaTech MOOC on mobile robots. (Making the repository public as these assignments were optional in the 2019 version of the course and might help others who got stuck while solving them.)

Have a look at the manual provided in each week to understand the objective of each assignment.

Final assignment review: If you change the goal location, the controller doesn't reach the goal state! 

This again clearly shows how, many robots today are used in very specialized - in the sense that the parameters of the robot are carefully optimized for the specific goal at hand and major changes in the goal or environment would render the robot useless.
